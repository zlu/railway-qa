1. What should be done if the DCU display is dark or shows no power?
Expert Answer (Simple):
Disconnect all electrical loads and measure current consumption.

Novice Answer (Full):
Disconnect all electrical loads and measure current consumption to check for overloads; use a higher-capacity DCU if needed.
Inspect for water damage; replace with a water-resistant DCU (e.g., TS in housing XL) if damaged.
Verify input voltage; restore correct mains supply per technical data.
If the DCU remains non-functional in delivery condition (all cables disconnected), replace the DCU.
