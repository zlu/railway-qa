3. How should a train operator respond when all doors fail to close?
Answer:                        
1）A single door failing to close: Check for obstructions, attempt to close the door again, and inform control if it remains open.
2) All doors on one car failing to close: Use the porter’s button (on the outside of each car) to close doors; if unsuccessful, check and reset relevant door miniature circuit breakers. If issues persist, inform control, operate the door isolating cock in the affected car, manually close the doors, and operate the TDIC (Train Door Interlock Cut-Out) switch.
3) All doors on the train failing to close: Shut down the driving cab, trip and reset the TMS2 miniature circuit breaker. If the fault persists, try closing doors using buttons in another driving cab; if still unsuccessful, inform control and follow their instructions.
